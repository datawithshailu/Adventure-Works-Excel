# Adventure Works Sales Dashboard

This repository contains an Excel-based dashboard built using the Adventure Works Cycles sample database. Adventure Works Cycles is a multinational company that manufactures and sells metal and composite bicycles to commercial markets in North America, Europe, and Asia. This dashboard consolidates and visualizes sales and financial data to help analyze company performance across multiple metrics.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create an interactive dashboard that provides insights into Adventure Works Cyclesâ€™ sales and financial performance. By integrating data from multiple sources, the dashboard allows users to perform detailed analysis on sales, profits, product performance, and regional breakdowns.

### Features:
- Year-wise sales analysis with Top 5 markets by sales.
- Quarter-wise sales analysis in a pie chart.
- Month-wise sales trend displayed in a line chart.
- Top 5 products by region in a bar chart.
- Top 5 customers by region, with a bar-line chart showing product counts and profit.
- Combination chart displaying sales amount and product standard cost for each month.
- Key metrics such as total sales, total profit, and average sales by region.
- Two interactive slicers for filtering data by year and region.

## Data Sources

The dashboard pulls data from the following sheets:
- **Fact Internet Sales**: Contains transactional sales data, including product IDs, order quantity, unit price, and unit discount.
- **Product**: Provides product-related data such as product name, unit price, and product standard cost.
- **Customer**: Includes customer details like full name, region, and customer ID.
